# tug-app

This App is a very simple Android-App Data Producer for the TUG-Test (Timed up and go, [see here](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timed_up_and_go_test)).
It uses the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope and transmits the data to a RabbitMQ-Instance. 

Heartrate (BPM) is also supported with a wearable extension.
